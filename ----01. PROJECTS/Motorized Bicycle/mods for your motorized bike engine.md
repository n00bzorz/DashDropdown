### Absolute NECESSARY mods for your motorized bike engine

> [!info] + # **Summary**
>
> - Pretty much ALL motorized bike kits come with manufacturing defects, which include burs in transfers, castings flaws in/around ports, metal shards in the exhaust, unsatisfactory lubrication, etc. Depending on your kit/engine, all of these issues can be easily fixed but can be CATISTROFIC if left unchecked.
> This engine maintenance guide provides essential information for maintaining and optimizing engine performance. The guide covers various issues related to top-end defects, centering magneto, lubrication, spark plugs, ring snags, and squish gaps. By following the recommended steps and precautions, users can address common engine problems and ensure their engines run smoothly and reliably. The guide emphasizes the importance of proper inspection, adjustment, and maintenance to prevent potential damage and optimize engine performance.

> #### ISSUE 1: TOP END DEFECTS <br>
#defects #maintenance
> 
> ##### The first thing you want to check on your engine is if the cylinder walls are clean and without defects, the ports look clean of casting flakes/flaws, the rings are prepped correctly, and the piston is installed correctly.
> 
> STEP 1: To do this, remove the 4 bolts on the top of the engine and remove the cylinder head and cylinder.
> 
> STEP 2: Examine Cylinders for burs or casting flakes in the ports. If there are any casting flaws around the ports, carefully remove them with a file.
> 
> STEP 3: Even if filing is not needed, take a paper towel and wipe down cylinder walls to ensure all debris is removed.
> 
> STEP 4: Following the instructional videos, remove piston rings and prep them with sandpaper, making sure to re-install them correctly. How to Remove rings, Rings Prep video, Piston Ring Install, Re-installing Cylinder (Arrow points toward exhaust).
> 
> #### ISSUE 2: CENTERING MAGNETO #[[magneto]] #[[ignition]]
> 
> ##### The engine uses a simple ignition system that involves a magneto generating an electrical pulse from a spinning magnet from the crankshaft. On many of these engines, the magnetos are not centered around the magnet, an issue that inevitably results in weak spark, or even the magnet chewing into the magneto. Thankfully, the fix is a simple one.
> 
> STEP 1: Remove the square-ish engine cover on the side of the engine (has 4 screws).
> 
> STEP 2: The magneto has 4 Philips head screws. Once loosened, position the magneto equidistant from the top and bottom of the magnet, while also making sure the magneto and magnet do NOT make contact.
> 
> STEP 3 (OPTIONAL): The magneto has 3 wires, the main two (Black and Blue/Red) are used to send ignition current to CDI, but the 3rd WHITE wire is UTTERLY useless. It is highly recommended to cut this off, but if you do, it is best to cut it off from where it comes out of the magneto.
> 
> #### ISSUE 3: LUBRICATION #[[lubrication]]
> 
> ##### It is pretty well known that almost any moving part needs some form of lubrication, however, obviously, the majority of kit manufacturers do not know this, because these engines COMMONLY arrive without a spec of grease.
> 
> STEP 1: Remove the clutch cover (Large cover on the right-hand side of the engine) and sprocket cover (cover with 3 bolts on the left-hand side of the engine).
> 
> STEP 2: Once removed, place some grease on bevel gears (MAKE SURE no grease gets on clutch pads), bucking bar, and bucking shaft.
> 
> #### ISSUE 4: SPARK PLUG!! #[[spark plug]]
> 
> ##### Even though the included spark plug will work, it may lead to the destruction of your engine. Thankfully, a top-of-the-line spark plug will only run you $5, and when your engine's well-being is on the line, it's DEFINITELY worth it. The NGK B6HS, BR6HS, and BP6HS (All perform identically) Plugs will perform optimally, providing more power, cleaner combustion, better cooling, and reliability.
> 
> #### ISSUE 5: RING SNAG!! #[[ring snag]]
> 
> ##### A MAJOR issue with some of these engines has to do with ring snag issues. If the rings snag, it can be VERY catastrophic to not just the engine, but the bike, and even to yourself, and even though this is not a common issue, it is still worth addressing.
> 
> STEP 1: Remove spark plug, intake, and exhaust.
> 
> STEP 2: Turn the engine over and take note if it feels as if the piston binds, or if there is a crunching sound. If not you are ALL GOOD.
> 
> STEP 3: If it feels as if your piston did bind at a certain point, repeat STEPS 1-4 of ISSUE #1.
> 
> #### ISSUE 6: SQUISH GAP!!!! #[[squish gap]]
> 
> ##### ALL of these engines come with Unsatisfactory squish gaps and compression, however, most of the time, the engine will still run without this issue being addressed. It is very simple to check the squish gap of your engine, but time consuming to fix the issue.
> 
> STEP 1: Remove Spark plug and get some solder.
> 
> STEP 2: Stick the solder into the spark plug hole, making sure the solder is against the cylinder wall, then crank the engine over, ONCE (May need to bundle up the solder so it will squish against the cylinder head).
> 
> STEP 3: After the solder has been squished against the cylinder head by the piston, remove it and measure its height with a caliper. If the width is between .7 and 1mm, your engine is ready to rip, however, if the solder has a height taller than 1mm, then you will need to deck the cylinder.
> 
> STEP 4: To deck your cylinder you will need to watch this video: 2:20 - 4:57 = How to find Squish gap and Deck Cylinder
> 
> # CONCLUSION:
> 
> After it is all said and done, you will have a great running engine that will serve you well for many rides to come (As long as you treat it well). Thanks for ALL the support and I hope I helped someone out there.
